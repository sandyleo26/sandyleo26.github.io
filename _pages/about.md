I'm a software engineer living Sydney Austrailia. Before that, I was in Shanghai study and working for about 7 years.

The avatar was my beloved cat "Sha Miao"（傻喵）. He is a little shy but very kind to people and his peers. I found him in our balcony and we happily co-habited together for over 1 year, until his owner found and took him back :cry:.
