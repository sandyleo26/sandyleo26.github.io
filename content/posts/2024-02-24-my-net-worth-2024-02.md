As hinted in my previous post, I want to publish my net worth and investment portfolio every month. I want to do this for a few reasons:

* Keeping records of my pursuit to financial freedom
* Hold myself accountable for the investment and spending decisions I make
* Many people are doing this and they seem cool üòé
* I need something to write about so I can complete my writing goals ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is an experiment. I don't know what it leads to. There might be downside which I'm not aware of but I hope net-net this is a positive thing to me.

So here it goes. All amounts are in Australian Dollar.

## Last words

So there you go. My net worth is not a secret anymore (not that someone's trying to get it). It is a milestone for my blog. The net worth is only a snapshot of my financial situation. In the future, I plan to share more details of why it becomes like this today and what are the changes I want to make.
