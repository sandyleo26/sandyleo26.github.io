OK. This is the placd I'm gonna use to write and publish my own blog. Not wordpress, medium or anything. Instead, Github Pages and Jekyll and my own custom domains are my choice.

Over the years, I've started and stopped writing blogs for a few times. Most of the time I quit after just 1 or 2 posts. I'll do my best to break that cycle for this time.

I don't want to expect too much from this blog. Just keep it going that's all. Make iterative improvement if I can. Use it as a tool for thinking about problems and remembering the answers. For now, the topics I can think of is my online learning experience and my life in Australia.

OK. So much for my first post.
