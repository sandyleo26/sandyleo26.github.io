I am a Software Engineer living in Sydney, Australia. I have a son which is about to turn 1 year old. In my spare time, I usually spend time with family and learning interesting things, including but not limited to, software engineering, value investing, FIRE(Financial Independence Retire Early) and politics.

The avatar was a cat called "Sha Miao"(傻喵) which I took care of for my neighbor a few years ago. I found him in our balcony and we happily co-habited together for over 1 year, until his owner moved and took him away :cry:.
